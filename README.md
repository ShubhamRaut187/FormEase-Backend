# FormEase-Backend 🗃️🌐
The FormEase-Backend repository is the robust Express.js backend application that powers the FormEase application. Developed using Node.js and MongoDB, this backend leverages the power of MERN stack technologies. It incorporates essential security features such as JWT tokens and bcrypt hashing for password storage, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user data. The repository provides well-defined endpoints for user authentication, enabling smooth and secure user sign-up and login processes. Additionally, FormEase-Backend facilitates seamless application form submission by users, with endpoints dedicated to handling CRUD operations for individual application forms. Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, is employed to define the data schema and create the data model, ensuring efficient and organized data management within the MongoDB database. FormEase-Backend serves as the backbone of the FormEase application, ensuring a reliable and secure backend infrastructure for users to navigate, submit application forms, and perform necessary CRUD operations.
